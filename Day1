land - eatehr surface
maritime- sea
space-greater than 100 kilometeres above mean sea level   enables cyberspace
cyberspace- global domain within the info environment consisting of an interdependant network. dependant on physical domains
            critical portion of cyverspace depends on space bc of satelites

layers of cyberspace

physical-tables netwroks and routers
logical- software and conenctions

MEF Information Group(MIG) coordinates integrates and employs capabilities for info environment operations in order to ensiur. Marines veriosn of ^

Expiditionary Advanced Base Opertaions(EABO)
Smallest footprint with most capabilites
Stand in forces, mobility, persistance, low signature,Integrate naval forces, cost efficient
Kinda like island hopping  spreading out our forces over multiple areeas instead of squating in one 


UFORCES
GLoabal Force Managemnets proccess which allows the SecDef to strategically manage the employment of the force among the CCDRs.
